I went in December around Christmas last year. December is considered to be the best time for visiting this place. I did not tour the entire Kerala but visited a small town near Trivandrum called Varkala, where I stayed for on a beach resort for over a week. The place has beautiful beach with quite many white chicks in bikinis. :)</p><p><img src="/assets/kerala01.jpg" alt="BeachView" /></p><h3 id="about-varkala">About Varkala</h3><p>It is a small town North of Trivandrum, around 54km from Trivamdrum Airport. I hired a pre-paid taxi from the Airport. The resort was quite difficult to found as it was situated on the Beach. Nontheless, I reached and had some nice dinner. I stayed in one of the beach resort named Bluewater Resort. The distance between shoreline and cottage was not more than 150 meters. At nights, I could actually sleep to the sound of waves. Amazing greenery and sea views. The hospitality was quite up to the mark too. They had two guys from Darjeeling as only they could understand English, as most of the visitors were foreigners. It has a very nice beach called Odayyam Beach. The wave action is quite amazing.</p><h3 id="food">Food</h3><p>The food in resorts over there is greatly influenced by Western Style, mostly Bristish. It came a surprise to me that local people donâ€™t prefer to eat Dosas &amp; Sambhar, they eat Fish with Rice. I had been to Tamil Nadu before and thought the entire South India likes Dosas. However they do make chicken and fish in their own style with special spices in it and it tastes wonderful. If you ever plan to visit the place, try <em><strong>Chettinadu</strong></em> of Chicken or Fish. <br /> <img src="/assets/kerala02.jpg" alt="Beach" /></p><p>I rented a Scooter for Rs 400 a day. Went to the far villages up north of Varkala driving all day.</p><p>Kerala dosent sell hard drinks, by hard drinks I refer to Whiskeys &amp; Vodkas. They do sell Beer &amp; Wine only. Wines mades in Kerala. They call it Wine Parlor as they really do have a full fledged sitting arrangement only for Beer &amp; Wine drinkers. I come from North India, where we see little places with steel windows, where they sell liquor, nobody wants to spend their money on Beer getting only a buzz. They buy and go home. So it came as a surprise to me.</p><p><img src="/assets/kerala03.jpg" alt="Beach02" /></p><p>To the South of my staying place had a famous Varkala Cliff, said to be the only cliff beach in the entire west cost of India. The place was good too with many locals and Tibet exhibits. <br /> <img src="/assets/kerala04.jpg" alt="Cliff" /></p><p>All in all it was a good vacation for me. I was actually rejuvinated after long working schedule. All I did was just nothing in those 6 days. I enjoyed every bit of it. The Beach, the Trees, the Ocean, the Sound of Waves.</p><div class="divider"></div><div class="pull-left"> <a style="font-family: 'Fjalla One';" href="/notes/tradeexample">Previous Post</a></div><div class="pull-right_next"> <a style= "font-family: 'Fjalla One';" href="">Next Post</a></div></article><div class="back"> <a style= "font-family: 'Fjalla One';" href="/">Back</a></div></main></body></html>
