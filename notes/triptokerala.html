We both planned on visiting Andamans in our first out-of-the-college trip. But when I looked it up, it becomes very expensive for Andamans with to and fro flights in December. I once even looked up for a sea plane but apparently they dont allow online bookings, if you book a berth you have to go and get it from the Chennai Office, and the schedule of carriers are not very pre-determined. It takes around 60 hours from Chennai to reach Port Blair. And plus they charge 8k for one berth in a 4 seater cabin. Eventually, I surfed more and found out Kerala could be one of the interesting place to spend a few days.</p><p>I found this place called Varkala, near Trivandrum. This has an amazing cliff beach, one of its kind in the entire east-coast of India!! Quite a few people have rated this place way above my initial expectation but its isolated from the main city and serene. The perfect thing I was looking for.</p><p>Now it is not costing me any cheap at all, December is supposed to be the peak season, but thats all when she is going get her vacation leave. Some flights even went upto 19k per person. The staying place I found in Varkala is supposed be very beautiful and more importantly as advertised quite close to the sea, rather its a sea facing cottage. I am hoping it turns out to be the place I have in mind right now. Today I have planned and made reservation for the entire trip. It really takes some serious business when planning such things. I am the one who never plan travels but wait for the last moment to get a train ticket in waiting list. I surely will write about the real trip.</p><p>Lets see how the God’s Own Country looks like!</p><div class="divider"></div><div class="pull-left"> <a style="font-family: 'Fjalla One';" href="/notes/processvsfunction">Previous Post</a></div><div class="pull-right_next"> <a style= "font-family: 'Fjalla One';" href="/notes/tradeexample">Next Post</a></div></article><div class="back"> <a style= "font-family: 'Fjalla One';" href="/">Back</a></div></main></body></html>
