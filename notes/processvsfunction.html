The FBO is considered to be Speacialists approach, for handling Businees Process. More middle managers and overlapping to Business Activities. The FBO is generally adopted by many primitive organizations in India. The Silos functions among themselves making more touchpoints and information flow harder between them. The advantges of having is FBO is central resouce pool. On the contrary Process Based Organizations are exatly opposite of FBO.</p><h2 id="understanding-process-based">Understanding Process Based</h2><p>It aims to breaks the silos and get the work done by the Business Process not persons. For eg: In FBO, the work suffers when the Doer is not available, while in PBO approach, you can the work done via established processes not persons. The notion of skills and competency are not factored in PBO. But the processes but written in such details that it can be executed by any person irrespective of skills and competency.</p><p>Now, when PBO is adopted by any organization, it must get prepared to expect fewer middle managers than there already were. The concept of working in teams is more emphasied in PBO not FBO. Though, it requires any organizations to have duplication of resources, which the organizations are willing to pay as a fixed cost. The variable cost automatically comes down by 30% if any organizations goes from FBO to PBO.</p><div class="divider"></div><div class="pull-left"> <a style="font-family: 'Fjalla One';" href="/notes/markdown-cheatsheet-demo">Previous Post</a></div><div class="pull-right_next"> <a style= "font-family: 'Fjalla One';" href="/notes/triptokerala">Next Post</a></div></article><div class="back"> <a style= "font-family: 'Fjalla One';" href="/">Back</a></div></main></body></html>
