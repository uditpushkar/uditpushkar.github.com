Entities could be persons, businesses, governments or countries. I will specifically take on the countries example here.</p><p>Countries have been exchanging goods as far back as we can remember. I ancient times, there was a barter system, where goods were exchnged for some other goods. Today, we exchange goods and give them somthing back. That something is called <strong>Currency</strong>. Also we know the famous Silk Route through which the entire European Continent used to trade with Indian Subcontinent and China as we call it today.</p><p>However, I write this not to indulge in the history of Trading but how it is done and what advantages does countries get out of trading.</p><h2 id="absolute-advantage">Absolute Advantage</h2><p>When a country after using all its resouces can produce somthing more that any other country, it has absoute advantage in it.</p><p>Let us take a example. Assume in this world only 2 countries exist. India &amp; France. The only two goods produced are Wheat and Wine. After utilising all its critical resouces, France can produce 150 bottles of Wine or alternatively 60 kgs of Wheat. On the other hand, India, after utilising all its critical resources can produce only 25 bottles of Wine, or alternatively 50 kgs of Wheat. In both case, France has <strong>absolute advantage</strong> over India in both goods.</p><h2 id="some-math">Some Math</h2><p>For very kg of Wheat France chooses NOT TO produce, how much Wine it can produce?<br /> 150/60 = 2.5 bottles (every kg of Wheat is worth 2.5 bottle of Wine in France). Where as in India, it is worth only 25/50 = 0.5 bottles of Wine. Thus, Wheat is <strong>more Expensive</strong> as compared to wine in France than it is in India. In the same way, India can produce 1/0.5 = 2 kgs of Wheat for a bottle of Wine, as against 1/2.5 = 0.4 in France, so Wine is more expensive in India.</p><p>With Above Capabilities, suppose India &amp; France <strong>Do Not Trade</strong>, and suppose they produce the following for self-consumption only.</p><table><thead><tr><th> </th><th style="text-align: center">Wheat</th><th style="text-align: center">Wine</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>India</td><td style="text-align: center">40</td><td style="text-align: center">5</td></tr><tr><td>France</td><td style="text-align: center">20</td><td style="text-align: center">100</td></tr><tr><td>Total Consumption</td><td style="text-align: center">60</td><td style="text-align: center">105</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Assume now the countries are willing to trade.</p><h2 id="what-can-we-say-about-the-likely-prices">What can we say about the likely prices?</h2><p>Will it be between 2.5 bottles and 0.5 bottles for a kg of Wheat? Why? Let us assume it is 1 bottle. This Price gives an incentive to:</p><ul><li>India because it can get twice the amount of wine( 1 bottle rather than 0.5 bottle)</li><li>France because it can get two and a half times wheat( 1 kg rather than 0.4 kg)</li></ul><p>At exchange rate greater than equal to 2.5 or less than equal to 0.5, at least one country has <strong>no incentive to trade</strong>. Within this range, both has incentive to trade.</p><p>A possible scenario if countries trade.</p><h3 id="france-exports-a-bottle-of-wine-against-import-of-a-kg-wheat-from-india">France exports a bottle of Wine against import of a kg Wheat from India</h3><table><thead><tr><th> </th><th style="text-align: center">Wheat</th><th style="text-align: center">Wine</th><th> </th><th> </th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td> </td><td style="text-align: center">Domestic Production</td><td style="text-align: center">Import/(Export)</td><td>Domestic Production</td><td>Import/(Export)</td></tr></tbody><tbody><tr><td>India</td><td style="text-align: center">50</td><td style="text-align: center">(10)</td><td>0</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>France</td><td style="text-align: center">16</td><td style="text-align: center">10</td><td>110</td><td>(10)</td></tr><tr><td>Total Consumption</td><td style="text-align: center">66</td><td style="text-align: center">110</td><td> </td><td> </td></tr></tbody></table><p>This shows that if countries trade, we have comparative advantage over absolute advantage. Extra resources are provided for consumption. In the above exampe also, the overalll consumption of Wheat and Wine increased to 6 &amp; 5 respectively. This is how countries benefit from Trading. A win-win situation for both the countries.</p><div class="divider"></div><div class="pull-left"> <a style="font-family: 'Fjalla One';" href="/notes/triptokerala">Previous Post</a></div><div class="pull-right_next"> <a style= "font-family: 'Fjalla One';" href="">Next Post</a></div></article><div class="back"> <a style= "font-family: 'Fjalla One';" href="/">Back</a></div></main></body></html>
